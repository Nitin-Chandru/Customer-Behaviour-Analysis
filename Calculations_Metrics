# Behavioural Metrics

This document defines how raw transaction data is converted into customer behaviour signals.

Instead of analysing individual purchases, the system evaluates customers using a small set of interpretable metrics.  
The goal is clarity — every value should represent behaviour that a non-technical team can understand.

## Overview

Each customer is described using three core behaviours:

| Metric | Answers |
|------|------|
| Frequency | How often does this customer return? |
| Value | How important is this customer financially? |
| Recency | How recently were they active? |

Together these form a simple behavioural profile.
