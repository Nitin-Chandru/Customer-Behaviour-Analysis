# Metric Definitions

This document defines how transaction records are converted into behavioural signals.

The goal is not statistical modelling but consistent interpretation.
Each customer is represented using a small set of stable measures that a non-technical team can reason about.

---

## Behaviour Model

A customer is described using three dimensions:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|------|------|
| Activity | Are they currently engaged? |
| Engagement | How often do they return? |
| Value | How important are they financially? |

Transactions become behaviour only after aggregation.

---

## Metrics

### Frequency
Number of purchases made by a customer.


Represents engagement level.

Interpretation:
- High → repeat customer
- Low → occasional buyer

---

### Customer Value

Total profit contribution generated by a customer.


Uses profit instead of revenue so behaviour reflects business impact rather than spending volume.

Interpretation:
- High → financially important
- Low → minimal contribution

---

### Days Since Last Purchase

Time since the customer's most recent activity.


Represents inactivity risk.

Interpretation:
- Small → recently active
- Large → at risk or inactive

---

### Activity Level

Scaled value used only for visual emphasis.


Larger visual marker indicates more recent activity.

---

## Segment Logic

Customers are grouped using behavioural thresholds instead of statistical scoring.


Segments are intentionally interpretable so non-technical teams can reason about them.

---

## Interpretation Guide

| Segment | Meaning | Typical Action |
|------|------|------|
| Loyal High Value | Frequent and valuable | Retain and prioritize |
| Frequent Buyers | Engaged but moderate value | Upsell opportunities |
| Big Spenders | High value but infrequent | Reactivation focus |
| Low Engagement | Low activity and value | Low priority |

## Design Principles

The system follows three rules:

1. Behaviour over demographics  
   Decisions should rely on actions, not attributes.

2. Clarity over complexity  
   Simple rules build trust before automation.

3. Understanding before prediction  
   Teams must interpret behaviour before modelling it.

---

## Role in the Dashboard

The interactive dashboard visualizes these metrics so users can:

- identify valuable customers instantly
- detect inactive high-value users
- explore retention opportunities
- understand behaviour without technical knowledge

This acts as a decision interface rather than a static report.

---

## Intended Evolution

1. Measurement — ensure consistent behaviour capture  
2. Understanding — interactive exploration *(current stage)*  
3. Action — automated targeting and retention

Reliable action depends on reliable interpretation.
