# Metric Definitions

This document defines how transaction records are converted into behavioural signals.

The goal is not statistical modelling but consistent interpretation.
Each customer is represented using a small set of stable measures that a non-technical team can reason about.

## Behaviour Model

A customer is described using three dimensions:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|------|------|
| Activity | Are they currently engaged? |
| Engagement | How often do they return? |
| Value | How important are they financially? |

Transactions become behaviour only after aggregation.
